# Database World Tour - Layout Guidelines

## 1. Philosophy

Our layout system emphasizes clarity, consistency, and focus. It aims to present complex information in an organized, digestible manner, facilitating learning and navigation. We utilize whitespace effectively and maintain a predictable structure across different content types.

## 2. Core Principles

*   **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent core structure across all pages and documents.
*   **Hierarchy**: Use visual hierarchy (spacing, size, placement) to guide the user's attention to important elements.
*   **Whitespace**: Employ generous whitespace to reduce cognitive load and improve readability.
*   **Responsiveness**: Ensure layouts adapt gracefully to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
*   **Focus**: Minimize distractions; the primary focus should always be the content.

## 3. Grid System

*   **Foundation**: Utilize a flexible grid system (e.g., CSS Grid or Flexbox) for structuring content areas.
*   **Max Width**: Implement a maximum content width (e.g., `1100px` for wide screens, `800px` for core text content) centered on the page to maintain optimal line lengths and visual coherence.
*   **Gutters**: Maintain consistent spacing (gutters) between grid columns and elements.

## 4. Key Layout Components

*   **Header/Navigation (Website)**:
    *   **Height**: Consistent height.
    *   **Content**: Logo/Project Title (left-aligned), primary navigation links (right-aligned or centered).
    *   **Behavior**: Can be fixed/sticky for easy access on longer pages.
*   **Main Content Area**:
    *   **Padding**: Consistent padding around the main content block (e.g., `2rem` or `3rem`).
    *   **Structure**: Primarily single-column for long-form text (documentation) to maximize focus. Multi-column layouts (e.g., for landing pages or comparison sections) should use the defined grid system.
*   **Sidebars (Optional)**:
    *   **Usage**: Use sparingly, primarily for secondary navigation (e.g., table of contents within a long document) or contextual information.
    *   **Placement**: Typically right-aligned.
    *   **Width**: Fixed or percentage-based width, clearly separated from the main content.
*   **Footer**:
    *   **Content**: Copyright information, links to related resources (e.g., GitHub repo), acknowledgments.
    *   **Style**: Visually distinct from the main content (e.g., different background color, smaller typography).
*   **Documentation Pages**:
    *   **Structure**: Title (H1), introductory paragraph, main sections (H2, H3), code blocks, diagrams/images, conclusion.
    *   **Navigation**: Consider a sticky table of contents (sidebar) for long documents.

## 5. Spacing System

*   **Base Unit**: Use a base spacing unit (e.g., `8px` or `0.5rem`) and derive all margins and paddings as multiples of this unit (e.g., `8px`, `16px`, `24px`, `32px`).
*   **Vertical Rhythm**: Maintain consistent vertical spacing between headings, paragraphs, lists, and other elements to create a harmonious flow.

## 6. Responsive Design

*   **Breakpoints**: Define standard breakpoints (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop) and adjust layouts accordingly.
*   **Mobile-First Approach**: Consider designing for mobile constraints first, then enhancing for larger screens.
*   **Fluidity**: Use relative units (percentages, `vw`, `vh`) where appropriate, but combine with `max-width` for control.
*   **Navigation**: Adapt navigation patterns for smaller screens (e.g., hamburger menu).

## 7. Implementation Notes

*   **Frameworks**: While not strictly required, CSS frameworks (like Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS utility classes) can aid in implementing responsive grids and consistent spacing, *provided they are configured to match these guidelines*.
*   **Consistency Checks**: Regularly review layouts across different pages and screen sizes to ensure adherence to the guidelines.
