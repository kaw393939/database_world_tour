# Database World Tour: A Graduate Text

Welcome to the Database World Tour! This project serves as a comprehensive overview of various database models, designed as a reference text for Computer Science graduate students.

We explore the fundamental concepts, use cases, popular implementations, strengths, and weaknesses of different database paradigms. Understanding these diverse approaches is crucial for selecting the right tool for the job in modern software architecture.

## Database Types Explored

Below is a summary of the database models covered in this text. Click the links to dive deeper into each type:

*   **[Relational Databases (SQL)](./docs/01_relational_databases.md)**
    *   *Teaser*: The bedrock of structured data management for decades. Learn about tables, rows, schemas, ACID transactions, and the power of SQL for ensuring data integrity and complex querying. Essential for ERP, CRM, and financial systems.

*   **[Document Databases](./docs/02_document_databases.md)**
    *   *Teaser*: Embrace flexibility with databases that store data in JSON-like documents. Ideal for evolving schemas, content management, product catalogs, and user profiles where data structures vary.

*   **[Key-Value Stores](./docs/03_key_value_stores.md)**
    *   *Teaser*: Simplicity and speed are paramount. Discover how these databases excel at lightning-fast lookups using unique keys, making them perfect for caching, session management, and real-time leaderboards.

*   **[Graph Databases](./docs/04_graph_databases.md)**
    *   *Teaser*: Focus on the connections! Explore how graph databases model and query complex relationships efficiently using nodes and edges. The go-to choice for social networks, recommendation engines, and fraud detection.

*   **[Column-Family Databases (Wide-Column)](./docs/05_column_family_databases.md)**
    *   *Teaser*: Built for big data and high write throughput. Understand how storing data by columns enables massive scalability and efficient analytics over vast datasets, common in logging, time-series, and IoT applications.
